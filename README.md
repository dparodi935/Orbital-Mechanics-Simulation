# Orbital-Mechanics-Simulation
Gravity simulation designed for spacecraft orbital mechanics

Features: 
- Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg Integrator
- Execute maneuvers
- Create both 2D and 3D animations

Note: There are still some rendering issues for the 3D animations

This video demonstrates a spacecraft in a geostationary orbit executing a burn to conduct a slingshot around the Moon:
